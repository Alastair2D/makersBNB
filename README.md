We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

Headline specifications

Any signed-up user can list a new space.

```
as a user,
so i can list my property,
i want to be able to add my property to the list.

as a user,
so i can use the website,
I want to be able to log in with an email and password.

as a user,
so i can hire a space,
i want to be able to select a listed property to hire.

as a user,
so i know if i can book a place,
I want to be able to see if a place is available

```



Users can list multiple spaces.
Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.


Nice-to-haves

Users should receive an email whenever one of the following happens:
They sign up
They create a space
They update a space
A user requests to book their space
They confirm a request
They request to book a space
Their request to book a space is confirmed
Their request to book a space is denied
Users should receive a text message to a provided number whenever one of the following happens:
A user requests to book their space
Their request to book a space is confirmed
Their request to book a space is denied
A ‘chat’ functionality once a space has been booked, allowing users whose space-booking request has been confirmed to chat with the user that owns that space
Basic payment implementation though Stripe.
